# Illustratr Child Theme

My version of the wordpress theme [Illustratr](https://wordpress.org/themes/illustratr/)

I'm using a child theme instead of a fork so that I can automatically update the parent and preserve my modifications

Current list of modifications:
* Removed the red box that appears when you hover over a portfolio project image, leaving the fade-to-grayscale effect
* Removed the attributions at the bottom of the theme (along with most of the other footer content) to make it as clean as possible
